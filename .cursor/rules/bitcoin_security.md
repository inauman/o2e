# Bitcoin Multisig Security Guidelines

## Core Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
- Implement multiple layers of security controls
- No single point of failure in the security architecture
- Assume breach mentality in design decisions
- Validate at every layer regardless of upstream validation

### Least Privilege
- Components should have minimal access to sensitive operations
- Separate key management from transaction building
- Implement role-based access in CLI operations
- Limit scope of each module to its specific responsibility

### Secure by Default
- All security features enabled by default
- Explicit opt-out required for any reduced security
- Conservative defaults for all security parameters
- Clear warnings for any security-reducing operations

## Key Management Security

### Hardware Security
- YubiKey and Ledger integration must use vendor-recommended security practices
- Never extract private keys from hardware devices
- Verify device authenticity before use
- Implement device connection timeouts
- Clear sensitive data from memory after use

### Hardcoded Key Security (Testing Only)
- Clearly mark as non-production code
- Generate unique keys for each test run
- Never commit real private keys to repository
- Implement secure key generation using cryptographically secure random number generator
- Store in memory only, never persist to disk

### Multisig Implementation
- Correctly implement BIP45 for P2SH multisig
- Verify all public keys before wallet creation
- Implement key sorting per BIP45 requirements
- Validate multisig script construction
- Test against known good multisig addresses

## Transaction Security

### Transaction Building
- Validate all inputs and outputs
- Implement fee estimation with bounds checking
- Prevent dust outputs
- Validate change addresses
- Implement transaction size limits
- Double-check recipient addresses (checksum validation)

### Transaction Signing
- Implement secure signing protocols for each device type
- Show transaction details on hardware device when possible
- Implement signing timeouts
- Verify signatures before broadcasting
- Implement transaction versioning
- Validate transaction hash before signing

### Transaction Broadcasting
- Implement retry with backoff for network issues
- Validate transaction acceptance in mempool
- Monitor for double-spend attempts
- Implement transaction replacement (RBF) carefully
- Log all broadcast attempts with transaction IDs

## Network Security

### Bitcoin Network Communication
- Use SSL/TLS for all API communications
- Validate SSL certificates
- Implement connection timeouts
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Support multiple Bitcoin API endpoints for redundancy
- Implement rate limiting for API calls

### Local Network Security
- Secure USB communication with hardware devices
- Implement device whitelisting
- Handle device disconnection gracefully
- Validate device responses
- Implement communication timeouts

## Data Security

### Sensitive Data Handling
- Never log private keys or seeds
- Mask sensitive data in logs and UI
- Clear sensitive data from memory after use
- Use secure memory handling when available
- Implement secure data serialization
- Validate all deserialized data

### Configuration Security
- Store sensitive configuration in environment variables
- Use secure storage for persistent configuration
- Validate configuration at startup
- Implement secure defaults
- Document security implications of configuration options

## Error Handling and Logging

### Secure Error Handling
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages
- Implement generic error messages for security-sensitive operations
- Log detailed errors internally
- Implement appropriate error recovery
- Validate system state after errors

### Security Logging
- Log all security-relevant events
- Implement structured logging
- Include context in security logs
- Never log sensitive data
- Implement log levels appropriate to security context
- Consider implementing audit logging for sensitive operations

## Testing Security

### Security Testing
- Implement specific tests for security features
- Test error cases and boundary conditions
- Implement fuzzing for input validation
- Test against known attack vectors
- Validate error handling in security contexts

### Multisig Testing
- Test with real hardware devices when possible
- Test all combinations of signing (2-of-3)
- Validate against known good multisig transactions
- Test recovery scenarios
- Test with different key types

## Implementation-Specific Security

### YubiKey Security
- Implement proper FIDO2/U2F protocols
- Validate YubiKey firmware version
- Handle YubiKey removal gracefully
- Implement proper PIN management
- Clear session data after use

### Ledger Security
- Implement proper APDU communication
- Validate Ledger firmware version
- Handle Ledger app state
- Implement proper device authentication
- Support secure display on device

### CLI Security
- Implement confirmation for sensitive operations
- Mask sensitive input
- Validate all user input
- Implement proper error messages
- Document security implications of commands

## Security Documentation

### User-Facing Documentation
- Document secure usage patterns
- Provide clear security warnings
- Document recovery procedures
- Explain security model
- Document security limitations

### Developer Documentation
- Document security architecture
- Document security assumptions
- Document threat model
- Document security testing
- Document security review process
