# Testing Standards and Practices

## Testing Philosophy
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) where appropriate
- Continuous Integration testing
- Shift-left testing approach
- Security-first testing mindset
- Component-based testing for React

## Test Types

## Test Environment

### Test Data
- Use appropriate test fixtures
- Mock sensitive data
- Use realistic test scenarios
- Clean test data after use
- Version control test data
- Document test data requirements
- Use test data generators where appropriate

### Backend Test Tools
- pytest as test runner
- pytest-cov for coverage
- pytest-asyncio for async tests
- pytest-mock for mocking
- pytest-benchmark for performance
- pytest-xdist for parallel execution

### Frontend Test Tools
- Vitest/Jest as the test runner
- React Testing Library for component tests
- @testing-library/user-event for user interactions
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Storybook for component documentation and visual testing
- Axe for accessibility testing
- Lighthouse for performance testing

### Continuous Integration
- Automated test execution
- Test environment setup
- Test result reporting
- Coverage reporting
- Performance metrics
- Security scan results
- Frontend build verification
- Visual regression testing in CI pipeline

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Follow coding standards
- Use type hints in Python
- Use TypeScript for frontend tests
- Document test code
- Review test code
- Maintain test code
- Refactor tests as needed

### Test Organization
- Logical test structure
- Clear naming conventions
- Group related tests
- Separate test types
- Maintain test independence
- Clean test setup/teardown
- Co-locate component tests with components

### Test Maintenance
- Regular test review
- Update tests with code changes
- Remove obsolete tests
- Improve test coverage
- Optimize test performance
- Document test changes

## Frontend-Specific Testing Practices

### Component Testing
- Test components in isolation
- Focus on component behavior, not implementation details
- Test user interactions as they would occur in the UI
- Test accessibility features
- Test component props and state changes
- Test error states and loading states

### React Hook Testing
- Test custom hooks in isolation
- Verify hook state changes
- Test hook side effects
- Test hook cleanup
- Ensure hooks follow React rules

### Form Testing
- Test form submissions
- Test validation logic
- Test error messages
- Test field interactions
- Test form state management
- Test form accessibility

### State Management Testing
- Test reducers in isolation
- Test context providers
- Test selectors
- Test state transitions
- Test async state operations
- Test state persistence

### React Query/SWR Testing
- Test query cache behavior
- Test query loading states
- Test query error handling
- Test query refetching
- Test query mutation operations
- Test query dependent queries

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user flows
- Test browser compatibility
- Test responsive layouts
- Test real API interactions
- Test in environments similar to production
- Test WebAuthn operations with YubiKey simulators
