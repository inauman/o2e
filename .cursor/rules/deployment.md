# Deployment Guidelines

## Deployment Philosophy
- Security-first approach
- Automated deployments
- Infrastructure as Code
- Immutable infrastructure
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Rollback capability

## Environment Setup

### Development Environment
- Local development setup
- Virtual environment management
- Development dependencies
- Local testing environment
- Mock services
- Debug configuration

### Testing Environment
- Isolated test environment
- Test data management
- Integration test setup
- Performance test setup
- Security test setup
- Monitoring setup

### Staging Environment
- Production-like setup
- Real service integration
- Data synchronization
- Performance monitoring
- Security monitoring
- User acceptance testing

### Production Environment
