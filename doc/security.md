# YubiKey Bitcoin Seed Storage POC: Security Considerations

## Security Overview

This document outlines the security considerations for the YubiKey Bitcoin Seed Storage proof-of-concept (POC). It is important to understand that as a POC, this application has been designed to demonstrate functionality rather than provide production-level security. However, it does implement several important security features and patterns that would be critical in a production implementation.

## Current Security Measures

### 1. WebAuthn Security

The application leverages the WebAuthn standard for authentication, which provides several security benefits:

- **Possession-based Authentication**: Access requires physical possession of the registered YubiKey
- **Phishing Resistance**: WebAuthn credentials are bound to specific origins, preventing phishing attacks
- **Public Key Cryptography**: Uses strong cryptography for the authentication process
- **User Verification**: Requires physical touch on the YubiKey to authorize operations
- **No Shared Secrets**: No passwords or shared secrets are stored on the server

### 2. Seed Phrase Protection

- **BIP39 Standard Compliance**: Uses established Bitcoin standards for seed generation
- **Entropy Sources**: Uses cryptographically secure random number generation
- **Secure Memory Management**: Implements automatic clearing of sensitive data
- **Memory Timeouts**: Seeds are automatically cleared from memory after configurable timeout
- **Minimal Exposure**: Seed phrases are only displayed when necessary

### 3. Transport Security

- **HTTPS Requirement**: All WebAuthn operations require a secure context (HTTPS)
- **Challenge-Response Authentication**: Uses cryptographic challenges and responses
- **Origin Validation**: WebAuthn credentials are bound to specific origins

## Security Limitations

As a POC, this application has several important security limitations that would need to be addressed for production use:

### 1. Encryption Limitations

- **Simplified Encryption**: The POC uses base64 encoding instead of proper encryption for seed storage (To be addressed in MVP2)
- **No Key Derivation**: Proper key derivation from WebAuthn attestation is not implemented (To be addressed in MVP2)
- **No Forward Secrecy**: The system does not implement forward secrecy

### 2. Storage Limitations

- **File-based Storage**: Uses JSON files rather than secure database storage (To be addressed in MVP2)
- **No Proper Key Management**: Lacks proper key management infrastructure (To be addressed in MVP2)
- **No Backup Mechanism**: No secure method for backing up encrypted seeds

### 3. Authentication Limitations

- **Single Device Registration**: No support for multiple YubiKeys (backup devices) (To be addressed in MVP2)
- **No Revocation Mechanism**: No way to revoke a compromised YubiKey (To be addressed in MVP2)
- **Limited Session Management**: Basic session management only

## Recommended Security Enhancements

For a production implementation, the following enhancements would be necessary:

### 1. Encryption Enhancements

- **Proper Key Derivation**: Implement key derivation from WebAuthn attestation or authentication (Planned for MVP2)
- **Strong Encryption**: Use AES-GCM or another strong authenticated encryption algorithm (Planned for MVP2)
- **Key Rotation**: Implement mechanisms for key rotation
- **Secure Key Storage**: Use hardware security modules (HSMs) for key storage

### 2. Storage Enhancements

- **Database Storage**: Replace file-based storage with a secure database (Planned for MVP2)
- **Encrypted Database**: Ensure the database itself is encrypted at rest
- **Backup Systems**: Implement secure backup mechanisms
- **Disaster Recovery**: Create disaster recovery procedures

### 3. Authentication Enhancements

- **Multiple Device Support**: Allow registration of multiple YubiKeys for backup (Planned for MVP2)
- **Credential Revocation**: Add mechanisms to revoke compromised credentials (Planned for MVP2)
- **Enhanced Session Management**: Implement proper session management with timeouts and revocation
- **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive security logging

## Threat Model

### Threats Mitigated

1. **Unauthorized Physical Access to Computer**: The seed cannot be accessed without the YubiKey
2. **Password Theft**: No passwords are used, eliminating password-based vulnerabilities
3. **Phishing Attacks**: WebAuthn is phishing-resistant by design
4. **Malware Keyloggers**: No passwords means keyloggers cannot capture authentication secrets

### Remaining Threats

1. **Physical Theft of YubiKey**: Possession of the YubiKey could grant access to the seed (Partially mitigated in MVP2 with multi-device support)
2. **Malware with Memory Access**: Sophisticated malware could potentially access seed phrases when decrypted in memory
3. **Server Compromise**: In the current implementation, seed data is only encoded, not properly encrypted (To be addressed in MVP2)
4. **Side-Channel Attacks**: No protections against timing attacks or other side-channel vulnerabilities
5. **Loss of YubiKey**: Without a backup mechanism, loss of the YubiKey means loss of access to the seed (To be addressed in MVP2)

## Best Practices for Users

Even with this POC, users should follow these security best practices:

1. **Physical Security**: Keep the YubiKey physically secure
2. **Secondary Backup**: Maintain a separate, secure backup of the seed phrase
3. **Clean System**: Use the application on a clean, trusted system
4. **Secure Environment**: Ensure no one can observe the screen when the seed is displayed
5. **Session Termination**: Always end the session when done viewing the seed
6. **User ID Protection**: Store the User ID securely; while not sufficient for access alone, it's still a required component

## Security Testing

For a production version, the following security testing would be recommended:

1. **Penetration Testing**: Professional penetration testing of the application
2. **Cryptographic Review**: Expert review of cryptographic implementations
3. **Code Audit**: Security-focused code review
4. **Automated Scanning**: Regular automated security scanning
5. **Fuzzing**: Input fuzzing to identify edge cases and vulnerabilities

## Conclusion

This proof-of-concept implements several important security features through the use of WebAuthn and secure memory management. However, for production use, significant security enhancements would be required, particularly in the areas of encryption, key management, and storage security.

The primary value of this POC is in demonstrating the concept of YubiKey-protected Bitcoin seed storage, not in providing a production-ready solution. Users should be aware of the limitations and consider established hardware wallet solutions for actual Bitcoin storage.

## Upcoming Security Improvements (MVP2)

MVP2 will address several key security limitations of the initial proof-of-concept:

### 1. Proper Encryption with AES-256-GCM

- Replace base64 encoding with authenticated encryption
- Implement envelope encryption pattern with Data Keys and Wrapping Keys
- Use HKDF-SHA256 for proper key derivation from WebAuthn authentication results
- Include integrity verification for all encrypted data

### 2. Multiple YubiKey Support

- Allow registration of up to 5 YubiKeys per user
- Enable any registered YubiKey to decrypt the seed
- Use FIDO2 hmac-secret extension for device-specific secret generation
- Implement unique salt per device for better security isolation
- Add credential management and selective revocation

### 3. Improved Storage Security

- Replace JSON files with SQLite database
- Implement proper database schema with relationships
- Use transactions for data integrity
- Maintain proper isolation between user data

### 4. Enhanced User Experience

- Guide users through security-critical operations
- Implement clear security messaging
- Provide better recovery options through multiple device support

These improvements will significantly enhance the security posture of the application while maintaining the core value proposition of YubiKey-protected Bitcoin seed storage.
