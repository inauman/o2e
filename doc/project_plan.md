## Notes and Decisions
- Using `trezor-crypto` or `bip39` libraries for seed generation to ensure BIP39 compliance
- WebAuthn implementation must be tested on both Chrome and Safari
- All Python commands must be run with venv activated
- Using uv for package management instead of pip
- For security, seed phrase should be displayed as little as possible during testing 
- User Interface templates completed: base.html, index.html, register.html, authenticate.html, view_seed.html, store_seed.html, test_yubikey.html, error.html
- Core Bitcoin functionality implemented with full BIP39 compliance
- WebAuthn registration and authentication flows implemented but need testing
- Added SecureMemoryManager for automatic clearing of sensitive data in memory
- Documentation completed: usage guide, architecture document, security considerations, and future roadmap
- Test scripts created for all functionality: registration, authentication, storage, and end-to-end testing
